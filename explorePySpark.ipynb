    "You'll probably notice that code takes longer to run than you might expect. This is because Spark is some serious software. It takes more time to start up than you might be used to. You may also find that running simpler computations might take longer than expected. That's because all the optimizations that Spark has under its hood are designed for complicated operations with big data sets. That means that for simple or small problems Spark may actually perform worse than some other solutions!  \n",

Creating multiple `SparkSession`s and `SparkContext`s can cause issues, so it's best practice to use the `SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()` method. This returns an existing `SparkSession` if there's already one in the environment, or creates a new one if necessary!  \n",
